# React Props Practice

This repository is designed to help developers practice and understand how to use Props in React. Props (short for "properties") are a fundamental concept in React, allowing components to receive data and configuration from their parent components. By working through the examples and exercises in this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with passing, using, and validating props in various scenarios.
